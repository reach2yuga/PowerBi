DATA PREPARATION:

I used 3 datasets each of different types. 
The sales is a combination of 4 years of sales data separated in 4 csv files.
The country is an excel file contains the country and country code.
The products is a text file which contains Id, category and products.

If you see the data I made in my pbix file, it also contains 3 more tables which I made of my own for more detail visualization.
The location table contains location id, location and country code.
The sales_new table contains the sales data but with new relationships and references to the other tables.
The other table is made using the data view option which is on the left side of power bi which is under the report view.
The date table contains weekday name, weekend name, month name, day, date,year and whether it is weekend or not. 

These data will be useful for getting more detail and interactive dashboards.
